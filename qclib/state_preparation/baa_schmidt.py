    State preparation using the bounded approximation algorithm via Schmidt

    For instance, to initialize the state a|00> + b|10> (|a|^2+|b|^2=1)
        $ state = [a, 0, b, 0]
        $ circuit = initialize(state)

    Parameters
    ----------
    state_vector: list of float or array-like
        A unit vector representing a quantum state.
        Values are amplitudes.

    max_fidelity_loss: float
        ``state`` allowed (fidelity) error for approximation (0 <= ``max_fidelity_loss`` <= 1).
        If ``max_fidelity_loss`` is not in the valid range, it will be ignored.

    isometry_scheme: string
        Scheme used to decompose isometries.
        Possible values are ``'knill'`` and ``'ccd'`` (column-by-column decomposition).
        Default is ``isometry_scheme='ccd'``.

    unitary_scheme: string
        Scheme used to decompose unitaries.
        Possible values are ``'csd'`` (cosine-sine decomposition) and ``'qsd'`` (quantum
        Shannon decomposition).
        Default is ``unitary_scheme='qsd'``.

    strategy: string
        Method to search for the best approximation (``'brute_force'`` or ``'greedy'``).
        For states larger than 2**8, the greedy strategy should preferably be used.
        Default is ``strategy='greedy'``.

    max_combination_size: int
        Maximum size of the combination ``C(n_qubits, max_combination_size)``
        between the qubits of an entangled subsystem of length ``n_qubits`` to
        produce the possible bipartitions
        (1 <= ``max_combination_size`` <= ``n_qubits``//2).
        For example, if ``max_combination_size``==1, there will be ``n_qubits``
        bipartitions between 1 and ``n_qubits``-1 qubits.
        The default value is 0 (the size will be maximum for each level).

    use_low_rank: bool
            If set to True, ``rank``>1 approximations are also considered. This is fine
            tuning for high-entanglement states and is slower.
            The default value is False.

    return_node: bool
            If set to true, returns also the best node for the
            decomposition/approximation

    Returns
    -------
    circuit: QuantumCircuit or Tuple[QuantumCircuit, Node]
        QuantumCircuit to initialize the state or if return_node==True, returns
        a tuple with the QuantumCircuit and the best node for
        decomposition/approximation.
